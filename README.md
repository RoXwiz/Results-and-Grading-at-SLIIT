## What is a Conceded Pass?

Conceded Pass (PC) grades are available in some circumstances in undergraduate programs. A student cannot request a conceded pass. A conceded pass may only be offered by the institute upon the recommendation of the Senate. The Institute's Board of Examiners will be responsible for determining the eligibility and awarding of conceded passes.

A conceded pass will be recorded as a (PC) grade. The numeric marks remain unchanged.

Conceded passes are not available in postgraduate coursework units.

**Please refer to the Rule book section 3.2.3 for more information.**

## What is a D Pass / D Criteria?

To obtain a D pass, you need to have fulfilled all of the following criteria:

- Pass the rest of the modules in the 1st attempt.
- Only one module should be pending.
- The grade must be D, D+, or C- (E, D- will not be considered).
- The GPA must be 2.00 or above.

D criteria is not applicable for English modules.

## What is WGPA or the Weighted Grade Point Average?

The Weighted Grade Point Average is computed by dividing the sum of the products of the number of credits of all the courses followed and the grade points earned for those courses by a student in a year, by the total number of credits for the courses followed that year. [Learn more](https://support.sliit.lk/kb/articles/grading-at-sliit)

This is then multiplied by an appropriate weighting factor and summed up over the total number of years related to the specific academic qualification.

**WGPA weighting factor assigned as per Faculty is as follows:**

- School of Business (1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year, 4th year) – 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%
- Faculty of Computing (1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year, 4th year) – 0, 20%, 30%, 50%
- Faculty of Engineering (1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year, 4th year) – 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%

This weighted GPA is taken into consideration when deciding on awarding classes for students of 2017 intake onwards.
